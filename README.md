Bridge project is a public oracle system on TRON network through which users can inject real world’s data into their TRON smart contract.

In order to integrate a TRON smart contract with Bridge oracle system, you can easily import an appropriate API contract to connect proper corresponding connector. API contracts which are imported into users’ smart contract, provides Bridge_query(…) method through which they can submit their request for real world’s data.

In order to study examples of integrating Bridge API into a smart contract, please refer to Bridge document. In this document, you can learn about various kind of oracle APIs and various data sources in each that are provided by Bridge oracle system and study examples of each case.
